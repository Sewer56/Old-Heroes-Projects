# Sonic-Heroes-GH-Launcher
A launcher written by myself from scratch by request of Muzzarino for Sonic Heroes: Greatest Hits. 
This is a complete replacement, extension and an application granting additional modification options for the Greatest Hits mod, 
a fork of another application that I am working on in terms of design. 

In addition, this is a complete replacement for the stock launcher. 
This application may be used with any Sonic Heroes Executable. 
Enjoy the extra options such as Borderless Windowed! 

Application theme and visual style, all original by Sewer56lol, 2017.
