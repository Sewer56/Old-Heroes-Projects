# Heroes Live Edit

HeroesLiveEdit is an old Sonic Heroes utility and advanced launcher which acts akin to a trainer, exposing various different functionalities to the end user as well as providing .exe editing options.

There is nothing astoundingly special about this launcher in the unfinished state it was left in - this launcher has been entirely superseeded by the Heroes Mod Loader.
