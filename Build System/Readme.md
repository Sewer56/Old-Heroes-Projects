# Old Heroes Projects

This is a public archive & listing that I am making available of my old or unfinished/unreleased Sonic Heroes projects. None of the projects written here are longer maintained and may have been either been completely obsoleted, poorly written or have poor coding standards from my early days when I have started programming.

None of the projects here should be used anymore, however may perhaps inspire someone else or somehow become useful for someone at some point in the future.

The following projects are available for archival purposes:
```
[Greatest Hits Launcher] A launcher written within the space of 13 hours from scratch by request for the Sonic Heroes: Greatest Hits custom game executable. 

[HeroesLiveEdit] An old Sonic Heroes utility and advanced launcher which acts akin to a trainer, exposing various different functionalities to the end user including custom hotkeys as well as providing .exe editing options.
